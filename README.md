## An AI-bot in Telegram that helps to come up with bright and interesting characters for the board role-playing games Dungeons & Dragons (D&D 5e).

### What a bot can do:

- Creates full-fledged character concepts;
- Generates deep and vivid backstories with motivation, secrets and internal conflicts;
- Offers unusual but balanced and playable combinations of race, class, character, and worldview;
- Generates story hooks that are easy to embed into the campaign;
- Supports both serious, tragic characters and frankly absurd and comical characters.
